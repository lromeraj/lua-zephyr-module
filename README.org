This repository provides an example of how the Lua language can be integrated in a project using the Zephyr embedded operating system.

* Building

1. First you'll need the Zehpyr SDK: https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html
2. Once extracted, run the setup script =cd ~/zephyr-sdk-0.XX.X/; bash setup.sh=
3. Then, install west =pip install west=
4. Get the Zephyr source code: =west init zephyr=
5. =cd zephyr=
6. =west update=
7. =west zephyr-export=
8. =pip install -r zephyr/scripts/requirements.txt=
9. Clone this repository inside of the zephyr directory
10. Build with =west build -b teensy41=

The resulting program can be uploaded to the Teensy with the [[https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader.html][Teensy Loader]]

* Lua configuration

This repository configures Lua in the following way.

- 32 bit mode is enabled (=LUA_32BITS= option)
- The =lua_writestring= family of macros is changed to be compatible with Zehpyr's =stdout=
- Some default libraries that won't work with Zephyr have been disabled

* Bindings

A Lua library has been added to access some of the Zephyr features from a Lua script. See =./src/luazephyrlib.c=
